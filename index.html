					<h2>Serving the Erie area for over 16 years</h2>
					<p>
					Buying a home is one of the single largest investments a person will make in their lifetime, and getting a home inspection is one of the best ways to help protect this investment. A pre-purchase home inspection is designed to highlight the positive aspects of the property as well as point out those features that may need attention.
					</p>
					<p>
					During your inspection, I'll evaluate the property's current condition and estimate repairs and probable short-term expenses. At the end of the inspection, I'll hand you a thorough, hand-written report detailing everything that was found. Later on, I'll follow up with pictures and a summarized, typed report highlighting any notable deficiencies.

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
					My name is John Platz, and I've been involved in the commercial and residential building maintenance and construction fields for over 35 years. During this time, I became an expert in understanding building codes and construction techniques and have developed a keen eye for identifying issues with homes.
					</p>
					<p>
					Since 1997, I've performed over 3500 home inspections in and around the Erie, PA area, including Harborcreek, North East, Fairview, Girard, Springfield, McKean, Edinboro, and more. My goal, with every inspection I perform, is to work with your best interests in mind. I look forward to having the chance to be your home inspector.
